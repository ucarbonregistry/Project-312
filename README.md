# Project-312
800 KW Wind Power Project By M/s Plasma Alloys Pvt. Ltd
The project activity is a renewable power generation activity which incorporates installation and
operation of single Wind Turbine Generator (WTG) having capacity of 800 kW manufactured and
supplied Wind World respectively in district Devbhumi Dwarka of the state of Gujarat in India. This
project has been promoted by M/s Plasma Alloys Pvt. Ltd.
The WTG under the project activity was commissioned on 30/09/2015 by Gujarat Energy
Development Agency (GEDA), Government of Gujarat, India.
As per the ex-ante estimate, the project will generate approximately 1,752 MWh of electricity per
annum. The net generated electricity from the project activity is used for captive consumption by the
project proponent (PP). Wheeling agreement is signed between Paschim Gujarat Vij Company Ltd.
(PGVCL) and PP. The project activity would be displacing equivalent quantum of grid electricity
resulting in emission reduction of 1,576 tCO2 per annum. The project activity has been helping in
greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction by using renewable resources (wind energy) for
generating power which otherwise would have been generated using grid mix power plants, which is
dominated by fossil fuel based thermal powerplants.
